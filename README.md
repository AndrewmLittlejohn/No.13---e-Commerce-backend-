## Lessons Learned
  1. stronger understanding of Insomnia.
  2. Stronger understanding of routes and models.

## Things to learn
1. I want to gain and stronger understanding of the specifics that are being handled by both express and sequelize. I know they are doing a great deal of heaving lifting and would like a stronger understanding of the specifics. I think it would be easier to write good code with a stronger understanding of how they are facilitating my efforts. 


## Struggles

1. Not sure why but I add a lot of trouble with the .then and or async/await. 
  I still need to gain a better grasp of the granular differences in using .then and async/await. Out of a lack of other ideas I would try and go from one to the other which took a great deal of time and didn't really fully grasp what I was doing other than moving code from one format to the other. 
    I did get things to work with these changes though, not sure if there was other user error with insomnia that this covered up for but it worked!

2.  I don't fully understand how to use insomnia effectively, too often I would have an error but wasn't able to get any guidance regarding system errors that were occuring other than spending my time on stackoverflow.
